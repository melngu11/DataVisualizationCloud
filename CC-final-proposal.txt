MOTIVATION
Gun violence is a complex and pervasive problem in the United States, with firearms being responsible for thousands of deaths each year. With firearm-related deaths on the rise, there is an urgent need for evidence-based solutions to address the issue. By leveraging cloud-based tools and datasets related to firearms provisions, homicide reports, and school shootings, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and data-driven approach to tackling gun violence. The project seeks to uncover insights that can inform gun control policies and public safety initiatives, contributing to a safer and more secure society for all by enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence rather than conjecture or ideology.


PURPOSE
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of firearms-related violence in the United States, using datasets collected on Kaggle and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to analyze and display the data. The current datasets are “Firearms Provisions in US States”, “Homicide Reports, 1980-2014” and “School Shootings US 1990-present”. Analyzing these datasets will identify patterns and correlations between firearm laws and firearms-related violence. This website shall be user-friendly and intractable using maps and charts. Filters should be available for users to apply to data to tailor the visuals. The visualization of this data will help drive evidence-based solutions with the aim of informing gun control policies and public safety initiatives.
